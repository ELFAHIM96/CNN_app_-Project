## Datasets
[GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:

+ Single-image, multi-class classification problem
+ More than 40 classes
+ More than 50,000 images in total
+ Large, lifelike database
